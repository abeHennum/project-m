                    The history of soccer, also known as football, can be traced back over 2,000 years to 
                    ancient China, Greece, and Rome. During these times balls were made of animal hide or rock stuffed
                    with hair. Similar games were also played in Japan and Mexico. However, the modern game
                    of soccer originated in 19th century England.

                    The first football association was formed in England in 1863. Rules were 
                    established - but continued to change - and the size and weight of the match-ball 
                    standardised. Football continued to undergo rapid development into the 1900s, accelerated 
                    by industrialisation. Public school teams soon became the minority following the emergence of
                    factory and other work-based clubs. The best players received monetary incentives, and tickets 
                    were sold to the public - mainly members of the working-class - for matches.

                    Today there are as many as 211 professional football/soccer leagues in the world. And According 
                    to the Federation Internationale de Football Association (FIFA), football - or soccer as it is 
                    known in North America - is played by upwards of 240 million people worldwide.
